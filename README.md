## Fast Pizza ##

React App created with Vite, where the following was used to create an app that allows the user to order pizza & set order priority:
- React Router Data for routes, actions, loaders, error handling, and general form handling,
- Redux Toolkit to model the state (user / cart / order) together with Redux Thunks for async operations.

Styled with Tailwind CSS.
